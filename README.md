# BruteForceMetcalf
Project Assignment 



Overview

This script is a simple implementation of a time-based brute force attack to guess the password of a binary file vault.o. The password is assumed to consist of only lowercase letters, and the length of the password is fixed at 8 characters.




Requirements

Python 3.x

vault.o binary file





Usage

Make sure the vault.o binary file is in the same location as the brute_force.py script. 

Give execute permissions to the vault.o binary file by executing the following command in a terminal:
chmod +x vault.o

To run the script, execute the following command in a terminal:
python3 brute_force.py

The script will start generating and verifying the password combinations until it finds the correct password. The time taken to guess the password depends on several factors, such as the processing power of the machine and the time taken by the vault.o binary to verify each password.




Note

This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities. The use of this script may be illegal and can result in severe consequences.





Line - by - Line Description of the script:

import subprocess

import time

##These lines import the subprocess and time modules, which are used later in the script. The subprocess module allows us to run shell commands from within Python, and the time module provides functions for working with time and measuring time elapsed.


start = time.time()

This line sets the initial value of start to the current time, as returned by time.time(). The value of start is used later to calculate the time taken to run the brute force attack.


letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

This line sets the value of letters to a string containing all lowercase letters. This string will be used later to generate the password combinations.

for i in letters:

    for j in letters:
    
        for k in letters:
        
            for l in letters:
            
                for m in letters:
                
                    for n in letters:
                    
                        for o in letters:
                        
                            for p in letters:
                            
                            


This block of code generates all possible combinations of 8 lowercase letters by using 8 nested for loops. Each for loop iterates over the elements in letters, and the combinations are generated by concatenating the elements from each loop.


 password = i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p
 
 This line concatenates the current values of i, j, k, l, m, n, o, and p to form the current password.
 
 result = subprocess.run(["./vault.o", password], capture_output=True)
 
 This line runs the vault.o binary with the current password as an argument, and captures the output of the binary. The capture_output argument is set to True to capture the standard output and standard error of the binary as a string.
 
 
  if b"Success" in result.stdout:
  
  This line checks if the output of the vault.o binary contains the string "Success". If it does, it means that the current password is correct.
  
 end = time.time()
                                   
time_taken = end - start

This block of code sets the value of end to the current time, calculates the time taken by subtracting start from end, and sets the value of time_taken to the result. 

print("Password found:", password)

print("Time taken:", time_taken, "seconds")

break


This block of code prints the correct password and the time taken to find it, and then breaks out of all 8 for loops.


                            if b"Success" in result.stdout:
                            
                                break
                                
                        if b"Success" in result.stdout:
                        
                            break
                            
                    if b"Success" in result.stdout:
                    
                        break
                        
                if b"Success" in result.stdout:
                
                    break
                    
            if b"Success" in result.stdout:
            
                break
                
        if b"Success" in result.stdout:
